# React Native Expo App Setup Guide

This README outlines the steps to set up and run the React Native Expo app locally.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Configure Backend Connection**:
   - Open the `config.js` file in the root directory.
   - Add your IP address to the backend configuration section. 

3. **npm install**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Run the App with Expo**:
   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```
   - This command will start the Expo development server.
   - Once the server is running, you can open the app on a physical device using the Expo Go app or on a simulator/emulator.
